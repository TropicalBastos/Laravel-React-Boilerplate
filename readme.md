# Laravel - React Boilerplate

All you need to kick off a laravel - backend - react - frontend project!

## Setup
To setup the laravel side of things run the following:

`composer install`

And now for react, cd into `resources/assets` and then run:

`npm install`

And thats it!

## Deployment
To run the webpack watcher and the php server go to the root of the project and run:

`sh runserver.sh`

Any changes you make to the react javascript will be instantly updated via the webpack watcher
The standalone php server runs in the public folder as its root.

Happy hacking!
